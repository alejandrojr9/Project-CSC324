## Building a Basic Web App with Express

This repository is the step-by-step development of a basic web app, built with the [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) framework.  The terminal language that I was taught with this project was BASH.

To run this web app you must have node JS installed. We may use this commands in the terminal to access the web app.


```
npm install
npm start

```
