        Real Madrid are one of the most famous clubs in world sport; their record nine 
        Champions League wins to add to their 32 Spanish league titles makes them the 
        most successful team at home and on the continent.

        created a fan base far beyond the Spanish capital. Often referred to as the 
        "Galacticos" due to their tendency to buy the biggest stars in the game.

        Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo, the Santiago Bernabeu club is one of the powerhouses 
        of the game.
